Hi! My name is Duc Anh Nguyen. In Vietnamese, my name is written as Nguyễn Đức Ánh. You can call me Duc Anh for short.

Currently, I’m an AI Resident at Qualcomm AI Research, where I have the great opportunity to work under the guidance of [Dr. Toan Tran](https://scholar.google.com.vn/citations?user=PnwSuNMAAAAJ&hl=vi) and [Prof. Tan Nguyen](https://tanmnguyen89.github.io/).

I am looking for CS/ECE/Math PhD for Fall 2026!
