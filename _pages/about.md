Hi! My name is Duc Anh Nguyen. In Vietnamese, my name is written as Nguyễn Đức Ánh. You can call me Duc Anh for short.

Currently, I’m an AI Resident at Qualcomm AI Research, where I have the great opportunity to work under the guidance of [Dr. Toan Tran](https://scholar.google.com.vn/citations?user=PnwSuNMAAAAJ&hl=vi) and [Prof. Tan Nguyen](https://tanmnguyen89.github.io/).

Before this, I graduated as the **Valedictorian** (Rank 1st) in Honors Program at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics ([FAMI](https://fami.hust.edu.vn/)), Hanoi University of Science and Technology ([HUST](https://hust.edu.vn/en/)). During my studies, I was also a research student at the [HATLAB](https://fami.hust.edu.vn/hatlab/), mentored by [Dr. Thang Tran Ngoc](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=65LF4RQAAAAJ&hl=vi).
